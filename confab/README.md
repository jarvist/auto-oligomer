These script are helpers to manipulate a set of coordinates (Gaussian .log file, pdb) via Confab to generate a set of low energy conformers for further calculation.

This is a further development of ideas started in this blog post: http://jarvistmoorefrost.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/simple-oligomer-conformer-calculation/

The generation of the conformers relies on Noel O’Boyle’s confab program: http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/8 ; http://baoilleach.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/confab-systematic-conformation.html
